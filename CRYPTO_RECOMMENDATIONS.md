## How It Works

### Scoring Algorithm
1. **Recommendation Score (50-100)**: Based on price momentum, market cap ranking, volume, and supply analysis
2. **Trend Score (50-100)**: Evaluates recent price performance and momentum
3. **Momentum Score (50-100)**: Analyzes volume trends and price acceleration
4. **Risk Score (50-100)**: Assesses volatility, market cap size, and supply risks

### Recommendation Logic
- **Strong Buy**: Average score ≥ 80
- **Buy**: Average score ≥ 65
- **Hold**: Average score ≥ 45
- **Sell**: Average score ≥ 30
- **Strong Sell**: Average score < 30

### Technical Indicators
- **RSI Calculation**: Based on price changes over different timeframes
- **Trend Determination**: Uses 24h and 7d performance to identify direction
- **Support/Resistance**: Calculated as 85% and 115% of current price
